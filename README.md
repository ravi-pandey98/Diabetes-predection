Prediction of Diabetes using machine learning


The main objective of developing the current project entitled “PREDICTION OF DIABETES USING MACHINE LEARNING ” is to build effective system which is fast, accurate, consistence and reliable.


Diabetes is a name of a disease that makes person suffers when their blood glucose is very high. Sugar is very much important for our body, and to control the sugar level in our body Insulin is used and helps us to get the energy from the food. There can be a case when the body doesn’t make enough insulin and then the insulin does not able to take the glucose to your cells. Insulin is responsible for transporting sugar in form of carbohydrates to all body for their proper functioning. When the Insulin does not able to transport these sugars properly, the sugar remain in the blood and person suffers from diabetes.




The main objective of this project



     ->Reduce the workload on Hospitals

     ->It provides better and efficient service

     ->It gives user friendly environment.

     ->Time and man power can be more effectively utilized and online information can be easily available to the user.
 
 
 Tools and Platform  
 
   ->We have used Python (3.8)  syntax for making this application.

   ->The dataset that we used in this project  “Pima Indian Diabetes”  taken from Kaggle. 

   ->The entire application  executed on  Jupyter Notebook.
   
   
Module wise Description :


   ->Download dataset from kaggle.com
   ->Load the libraries and read the data.
   ->Replace missing values.
   ->Exploratory data analysis.
   ->Creating new features (to increase accuracy)
   ->Encoding features.
   ->Using LightGBM and optimize hyperparameters
   ->Adding a KNN to LGBM to beat 90% accuracy (voting classifier)


Future works

  ->Throughout this work Random Forest algorithms area unit studied and evaluated on varied measures. Perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with     a higher accuracy by using machine learning technique which provides advance support for predicting the accuracy rate of diabetes. To build a prediction     model for diabetes with 99.99% accuracy, we will need thousands of records with zero missing values. Our future work will focus on integration of other       methods into the used model for tuning the parameters of models for better accuracy.
