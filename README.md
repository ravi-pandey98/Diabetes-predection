Prediction of Diabetes using machine learning


The main objective of developing the current project entitled “PREDICTION OF DIABETES USING MACHINE LEARNING ” is to build effective system which is fast, accurate, consistence and reliable.


Diabetes is a name of a disease that makes person suffers when their blood glucose is very high. Sugar is very much important for our body, and to control the sugar level in our body Insulin is used and helps us to get the energy from the food. There can be a case when the body doesn’t make enough insulin and then the insulin does not able to take the glucose to your cells. Insulin is responsible for transporting sugar in form of carbohydrates to all body for their proper functioning. When the Insulin does not able to transport these sugars properly, the sugar remain in the blood and person suffers from diabetes.


The main objective of this project


 ->Reduce the workload on Hospitals

 ->Provide facility to check patient has Diabetes or not with help of mobile phone.

 ->It provides better and efficient service

 ->It gives user friendly environment.
